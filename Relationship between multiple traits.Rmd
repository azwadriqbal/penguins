## Relationship between multiple traits
Let's look at the relationship between body mass and flipper length among penguins, separated by species!    

```{r rel_multiple_traits, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(color = species, x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(shape = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')

```
